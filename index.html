            <h1>Game</h1>
            <p> Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. 
               The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. The scheme is often used in quiz shows and can be employed as an educational game.</p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>The application has 3 levels with different difficulty. In the first level, the player has on a desk 8 cards, in the second 12 cards, in the third 16 cards. In each turn, the player chooses two cards with a simple click and turns them face up. If they are equal - one pair is completed. If they aren't - next turn beginning to start without a matched point. If the player matches them all, then win. After the finished game, the player will be requested to fill the field witch username and then appear ranking.</p>
